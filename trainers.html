						<div id="Josh" class="panel-collapse collapse">
                            <div class="panel-body">Joshua Rasch has been physically coaching and mentally training youth for over ten years. He started out working with summer camps focused on encouraging teenagers to face their mental roadblocks and grow through controlled, challenging experiences. Realizing a passion for youth through this experience, he began to seek out unique opportunities to marry challenging, physical experiences with mindset growth and development. This vision quickly led to the opportunity to train and lead groups of youth to numerous countries including Botswana, Thailand, Panama, Costa Rica, and Mexico to do humanitarian and service work. He continued to build on these experiences back in the States by speaking to high-schoolers in the public school system on the self-esteem and relational challenges affecting so many teenagers. Currently Joshua splits his time between coaching students and adults, always carrying a strong focus on mental health and a strong mindset. Joshua lives in Washington DC and is active and outdoors as much as possible. He is a firm believer in the power of mindset training coupled with physical activity, and can personally speak to its transformative power. </div></div>
